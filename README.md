# Carlos Software Development Profile
Prototype:  My personal profile & professional portfolio.

An early start at creating my own portfolio website.  This is not the website I use to showcase my projects and/or apply to jobs with.  This was an early work and I like to have around to see how far I have progressed since then.

## Seriously
This is NOT my official website & portfolio.
Just an early fun work.

### My coding style

This profile was written in HTML, CSS, and Javascript only.
